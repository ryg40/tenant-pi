# Use the hooks in scripts/git-hooks (pre-commit, pre-merge-commit, pre-push)
# in this repository.
#
# The script copies scripts/git-hooks/dispatch to <git-common-dir>/scan-hooks,
# once for each hook, and sets core.hooksPath to that absolute directory. Git
# stores it in the shared configuration, so it applies to the main checkout and
# to each worktree. The dispatcher runs scripts/git-hooks/<hook> of the working
# tree where the hook runs, so each worktree uses the hooks and scripts/scan.sh
# of its own branch. On a branch that never had the scan, the dispatcher runs
# no scan and says why; if the branch has the scan in the index or in HEAD but
# not in the working tree, it refuses. See docs/secret-handling.md.
#
# Usage: scripts/install-hooks.sh [--check|--uninstall]
#   --check      change nothing; exit 0 if the hooks are installed and current, else 1
#   --uninstall  remove core.hooksPath and the dispatcher copies if this script set them
